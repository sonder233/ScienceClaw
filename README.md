## ✨ Why RpaClaw

<table>
<tr>
<td width="37%" valign="top">

### 🤖 RPA Recording & Automation

Record browser interactions and generate **Playwright scripts** automatically. RpaClaw captures your actions, generates smart locators, and creates reusable automation skills. Supports both Docker sandbox mode and local mode for flexible deployment.

</td>
<td width="32%" valign="top">

### 🔒 Security First

Runs entirely in **Docker containers** with isolated sandbox execution. The agent cannot access your host system or personal files. All data stays in local `./workspace` directory — nothing uploaded to external servers. Deploy with confidence.

</td>
<td width="31%" valign="top">

### 🚀 Ready Out of the Box

No tedious configuration needed. Launch with **a single command** using pre-built Docker images. 1,900+ tools and skill packages included. Whether you're automating workflows or building AI agents, get started immediately.

---

<a id="local-setup"></a>

## 🖥️ Local Development Setup

For developers who want to run services locally without Docker:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB (optional, for database features)
- Redis (optional, for task scheduling)

### Backend Setup

**1. Navigate to backend directory**

```bash
cd RpaClaw/backend
```

**2. Create and configure environment**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**3. Edit `.env` file with your configuration:**

```bash
# LLM Configuration
DS_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key
DS_URL=https://api.deepseek.com
DS_MODEL=deepseek-chat

# Storage Mode: 'local' or 'docker'
STORAGE_BACKEND=local

# MongoDB (optional - only needed for user management and sessions)
MONGODB_HOST=localhost
MONGODB_PORT=27017
MONGODB_USER=
MONGODB_PASSWORD=

# Sandbox (for Docker mode RPA)
SANDBOX_MCP_URL=http://localhost:18080/mcp

# Skills and Workspace
EXTERNAL_SKILLS_DIR=./Skills
BUILTIN_SKILLS_DIR=./builtin_skills
WORKSPACE_DIR=./workspace
```

**4. Install dependencies and run**

```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv run uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Or using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Frontend Setup

**1. Navigate to frontend directory**

```bash
cd RpaClaw/frontend
```

**2. Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

**3. Run development server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

**4. Open browser**

```
http://localhost:5173
```

### RPA Modes

#### Local Mode (No Docker Required)

Set `STORAGE_BACKEND=local` in `.env`. RPA recording uses CDP (Chrome DevTools Protocol) screencast instead of VNC. Playwright runs directly on your host machine.

**Advantages:**
- No Docker sandbox needed
- Faster performance
- Direct access to host browser

**Limitations:**
- Less isolation
- Requires Playwright installation on host

#### Docker Mode (Sandbox Isolation)

Set `STORAGE_BACKEND=docker` in `.env`. Requires sandbox container running. RPA uses VNC for display.

**Advantages:**
- Full isolation
- Consistent environment
- Safer execution

**Requirements:**
- Sandbox container must be running
- Access to `SANDBOX_MCP_URL`

## 🔧 Tools & Skills System

### 🧪 1,900+ Built-in Tools

RpaClaw integrates **ToolUniverse**, providing 1,900+ tools across multiple domains for automation, data processing, and AI-powered workflows.

### 🛠️ Four-Layer Tool Architecture

| Layer | Description | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| 🔧 **Built-in Tools** | Core search & crawl capabilities | `web_search`, `web_crawl` |
| 🧪 **ToolUniverse** | 1,900+ scientific tools, ready to use | UniProt, OpenTargets, FAERS, PDB, ADMET, etc. |
| 📦 **Sandbox Tools** | File operations & code execution | `read_file`, `write_file`, `execute`, `shell` |
| 🛠️ **Custom @tool** | User-defined Python functions, hot-loaded from `Tools/` | Your own tools |

### 🎨 Custom Tools

RpaClaw makes it easy to extend with your own tools:

- **Natural language creation** — Simply describe what you want in chat, and the agent will create, test, and save a new tool for you automatically.
- **Manual mounting** — Drop any Python file with `@tool` decorated functions into the `Tools/` directory; they are auto-detected and hot-loaded without restart.

### 🧠 Skill System

Skills are **structured instruction documents (SKILL.md)** that guide the Agent through complex, multi-step workflows. Unlike tools (executable code), skills act as the Agent's "playbook" — defining strategies, rules, and best practices.

#### Built-in Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| 🤖 **RPA Recording** | Record browser interactions and generate Playwright automation scripts |
| 📄 **pdf** | Read, create, merge, split, OCR, and generate PDF documents |
| 📝 **docx** | Create and edit Word documents with formatting, tables, and charts |
| 📊 **pptx** | Generate and edit PowerPoint presentations |
| 📈 **xlsx** | Create and manipulate Excel spreadsheets, process CSV/TSV data |
| 🛠️ **tool-creator** | Create custom @tool functions (write → test → save) |
| 📝 **skill-creator** | Create and refine skills with iterative workflow |
| 🔍 **find-skills** | Search and install community skills |
| 🧪 **tooluniverse** | Access to 1,900+ built-in tools |

#### Multi-Format Document Generation

RpaClaw can produce professional documents in **4 formats**:

| Format | Features |
|---|---|
| **PDF** | Cover page, table of contents, charts, citations, references |
| **DOCX** | Cover page, TOC, tables, images, Word-native formatting |
| **PPTX** | Slide decks with titles, bullet points, images, speaker notes |
| **XLSX** | Data tables, charts, multi-sheet workbooks, CSV/TSV export |

#### Custom Skills

- **Natural language creation** — Describe your workflow in chat, and the agent will draft, test, and save a new skill for you.
- **Manual installation** — Place a folder with a `SKILL.md` file into the `Skills/` directory. The agent automatically matches and loads relevant skills based on user intent.
- **Community ecosystem** — Discover and install skills from the open community with the built-in `find-skills` capability.
